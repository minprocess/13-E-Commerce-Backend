# 13-E-Commerce-Backend
## Description
Backend for an e-commerce website using Sequelize. Database is mySql on localhost and JawsDB on Heroku. The database has 3 tables: Category, Product and Tags. A category can has many products. A product can belong to only one category. Thus there is a one-to-many relationship between categoy and product. A product can have many tags. Thus there is a many-to-many relationship between product and tags.<br>


Deployment to Heroku

### Seed the Database

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

### Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.


## Usage
The following commands deploy to Heroku. The heroku CLI has to be deployed to the PC with the project
`heroku create`
`git push heroku main`

Heroku has a JawsDB addon that is mySQL compatible. This backend works with mySQL on the PC used for development or on Heroku.<br>

To seed the database on the development PC use
`node seeds/index.js`

To seed the database on Heroku use this command
`heroku run node seeds/index.js`

Insomnia can be used to perform CRUD operations with the database. Below are the 3 routes that can be used in Insomnia
https://frozen-plains-09933.herokuapp.com/api/categoriesgit /
https://frozen-plains-09933.herokuapp.com/api/products/
https://frozen-plains-09933.herokuapp.com/api/tags/

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
